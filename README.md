## 🔧 Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install trilium-py --user
```

## 📖 (Basic) Usage

These are basic function that Trilium's ETAPI provides. Down below are some simple example code to use this package.

### 🚀 Initialization

If you have a ETAPI token, change the `server_url` and `token` to yours.

```python
from trilium_py.client import ETAPI

server_url = 'http://localhost:8080'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN'
ea = ETAPI(server_url, token)
```

If you haven't created ETAPI token, you can create one with your password. Please note, you can only see this token
once, please save it if you want to reuse the token.

```python
from trilium_py.client import ETAPI

server_url = 'http://localhost:8080'
password = '1234'
ea = ETAPI(server_url)
token = ea.login(password)
print(token)
```

After initialization, you can use Trilium ETAPI with python now. The following are some examples.

### 📊 Application Information

To start with, you can get the application information like this.

```python
print(ea.app_info())
```

It should give you the version of your server application and some extra information.

### 🔍 Search note

Search note with keyword.

```python
res = ea.search_note(
    search="python",
)

for x in res['results']:
    print(x['noteId'], x['title'])
```

### 🏭 Create Note

You can create a simple note like this.

```python
res = ea.create_note(
    parentNoteId="root",
    title="Simple note 1",
    type="text",
    content="Simple note example",
    noteId="note1"
)
```

The `noteId` is not mandatory, if not provided, Trilium will generate a random one. You can retrieve it in the return.

```python
noteId = res['note']['noteId']
```

#### 🖼️ Create Image note

Image note is a special kind of note. You can create an image note with minimal information like this. The `image_file`
refers to the path of image.

```python
res = ea.create_image_note(
    parentNoteId="root",
    title="Image note 1",
    image_file="shield.png",
)
```

### 👀 Get note

To retrieve the note's content.

```python
ea.get_note_content("noteid")
```

You can get a note metadata by its id.

```python
ea.get_note(note_id)
```

### 🔄 Update note

Update note content

```python
ea.update_note_content("noteid", "updated by python")
```

Modify note title

```python
ea.patch_note(
    noteId="noteid",
    title="Python client moded",
)
```

### 🗑️ Delete note

Simply delete a note by id.

```python
ea.delete_note("noteid")
```

### 📅 Day note

You can get the content of a certain date with `get_day_note`. The date string should be in format of "%Y-%m-%d", e.g. "
2022-02-25".

```python
ea.get_day_note("2022-02-25")
```

Then set/update a day note with `set_day_note`. The content should be a (html) string.

```python
ea.set_day_note(date, new_content)
```

### 📤 Export note

Export note comes in two formats `html` or `markdown`/`md`.

```python
res = ea.export_note(
    noteId='sK5fn4T6yZRI',
    format='md',
    savePath='/home/nate/data/1/test.zip',
)
```

### 💾 Create data backup

This example will create a database backup file like this `trilium-data/backup/backup-test.db`.

```python
res = ea.backup("test")
```

You can use the cron utility in Linux to schedule regular automatic backups. For example, to set up a daily backup at 3:
00 AM, you would use the following cron expression:

```
0 3 * * * python /path/to/backup-script.py
```

### Get attachment info

Get image title and etc.

```
res = ea.get_attachment('Y5V6pYq6nwXo')
```

### Update attachment info

Change image title and etc.

```
res = ea.update_attachment(
    attachmentId='2b7pPzqocS1s', title='hello etapi', role='image', mime='image/png'
)
```

### Get attachment content

Get the real image file

```
res = ea.get_attachment_content('icpDE4orQxlI')
with open('1.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(res)
```

### Update attachement content

Replace the image with new one

```
res = ea.update_attachment_content('icWqV6zFtE0V', '/home/nate/data/1.png')
```

### Create attachment

Upload a image file as attachment of a note.

```
res = ea.create_attachment(
    ownerId='8m8luXym5LxT',
    file_path='/home/nate/data/ksnip_20230630-103509.png',
)
```

## (Advanced Usage) ✅ TODO List

With the power of Python, I have expanded the basic usage of ETAPI. You can do something with todo list now.

### Add TODO item

You can use `add_todo` to add a TODO item, param is the TODO description

```python
ea.add_todo("买暖宝宝")
```

### Check/Uncheck a TODO item

param is the index of the TODO item

```python
ea.todo_check(0)
ea.todo_uncheck(1)
```

### Update a TODO item

Use `update_todo` to update a TODO item description at certain index.

```python
ea.update_todo(0, "去码头整点薯条")
```

### Delete a TODO item

Remove a TODO item by its index.

```python
ea.delete_todo(1)
```

### Move yesterday's unfinished todo to today

As the title suggests, you can move yesterday's unfinished things to today. Unfinished todo's will be deleted from
yesterday's note.

```python
ea.move_yesterday_unfinished_todo_to_today()
```

## (Advanced Usage) 🚚 Upload Markdown files

### Upload single Markdown file with images

You can import Markdown file with images into Trilium now! Trilium-py will help you to upload the images and fix the
links for you!

```python
res = ea.upload_md_file(
    parentNoteId="root",
    file="./md-demo/manjaro 修改caps lock.md",
)
```

### Bulk upload Markdown files in a folder

You can upload a folder with lots of Markdown files to Trilium and preserve the folder structure!

#### Import from VNote

Say, upload all the notes from [VNote](https://github.com/vnotex/vnote), simply do this:

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="~/data/vnotebook/",
    ignoreFolder=['vx_notebook', 'vx_recycle_bin', 'vx_images', '_v_images'],
)
```

#### Import from Joplin

Joplin can be imported effortlessly.

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="/home/nate/data/joplin_data/",
    ignoreFolder=['_resources', ],
)
```

#### Import from Logseq

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="/home/nate/data/logseq_data/",
    ignoreFolder=['assets', 'logseq'],
)
```

#### Import from Obsidian

Obsidian has a very unique linking system for files. You should use [obsidian-export
](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) to convert a Obsidian vault to regular Markdown files. Then you should be
able to import the note into Trilium with trilium-py.

Convert it first.

```bash
obsidian-export /path/to/your/vault /out
```

Then import just like a normal markdown, trilium-py will handle the images for you.

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="E:/data/out",
)
```

#### Import from Youdao Note/有道云笔记

Youdao does not provide an export feature anymore. Luckily, you can use <https://github.com/DeppWang/youdaonote-pull> to
download your notes and convert them into markdown files. After that, trilium-py should be able to help you import them.

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="/home/nate/gitRepo/youdaonote-pull/out/",
)
```

#### Import from Turtl

You need to convert Turtl from json to markdown first.
See [turtl-to-markdown](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-py/tree/main/examples/turtl-to-markdown) for details.

Then you can import with trilium-py like this:

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="/home/nate/gitRepo/turtl-to-markdown/out/",
    ignoreFolder=['_resources'],
)
```

#### Import from other markdown software

In general, markdown files have variety of standards. You can always try import them with

```python
res = ea.upload_md_folder(
    parentNoteId="root",
    mdFolder="/home/nate/data/your_markdown_files/",
)
```

If there is any problem, please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-py/issues/new).

## (Advanced Usage) 🎨 Beautify notes

Because of the constraints imposed by the library utilized by Trilium, imported notes may experience minor formatting
problems. These issues include an additional line appearing at the end of code blocks, images becoming integrated with
the note content, and the absence of line breaks between headings, resulting in a cramped appearance of the note
content.

Here is what you can do to beautify your note.

### Beautify a note

Specify a note id to beautify note content.

```python
ea.beautify_note('krm8B9JthNfi')
```

### Beautify a note and its child notes

```python
ea.beautify_sub_notes('tlPuzU2szLJh')
```

## (Advanced Usage) 🧹 Sort note content

Sort a note by the heading names. This feature could prove invaluable for notes containing extensive lists, such as book
titles sorted into various genres. It's equally useful for managing browser bookmarks or collecting links.

Additionally, you have the option to specify a language code for sorting based on your local language. This enhances the
sorting process and tailors it to your linguistic preferences.

```
res = ea.sort_note_content('lPxtkknjR2bJ')
res = ea.sort_note_content('y6hROhWjNmHQ', 'zh_CN.UTF-8')
```

## 🛠️ Develop

Install with pip egg link to make package change without reinstall.
